# risiko

This is a multi-player version of Risiko! game written with Java RMI.
It is intended to be used with VPN (e.g. Hamachi).

If a group of people wants to play, then every one has to install
Hamachi on his PC. Then every one has to have the client on his PC.
This one is deployable with a JAR.

One member of the group has to host the server. So, one member must
deploy on his PC both the client AND the server. 

To start the game, one has to first start the server and after that, 
every one can start their client, pick a color, throw the dice for
the turns and play.
