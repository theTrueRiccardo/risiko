# risiko

This is a multi-player version of "Risiko!" game written with Java RMI.
It is intended to be used with a VPN (e.g. Hamachi) to which each player is connected.

Prerequisite for a group of people to play is to having installed Hamachi.
Every player must have also the client part of the game, which is shipped as a jar file.

One member of the group has to host the server. So, one member must
deploy on his PC both the client AND the server. 

In order for the game to start, the server must run and be set up before each client. 
After that, every one can start their client, pick a color, throw the dice for
the turns and play.
